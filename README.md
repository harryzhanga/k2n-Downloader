# k2n-Downloader
A program that downloads songs from k2nblog by web scraping. You need a lot of libraries for this, check the code to see which ones. 

To use
1. Download the appropriate libraries
2. Pick which pages numbers you want to download at the top of the code
3. Run and done!

Work that needs to be done:
1. Making the code simpler and more understandable
2. Being able to download from other sites besides mediafire
3. Being able to pick what sort of songs/albums you want eg singles or albums, from a particular artists...
4. Hence, possibly using the search function of the website
