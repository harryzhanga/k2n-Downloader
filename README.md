# k2n-Downloader
A program that downloads songs from k2nblog by web scraping. You need a lot of libraries for this, check the code to see which ones. 


To use
1. Download the appropriate libraries
2. Pick which pages numbers you want to download at the top of the code
2.5 Install the appropriate browser driver, eg Chrome, Mozilla... then change it accordingly in the code under the function get_mediafire, the first line. 
3. Set a wait time so you don't overload the servers! 
3. Run and done!
Warning: It will open internet browsers because it needs to wait for a redirect. Don't worry, it should close them after it is done.

Work that needs to be done:
1. Making the code simpler and more understandable
2. Being able to download from other sites besides mediafire
3. Being able to pick what sort of songs/albums you want eg singles or albums, from a particular artists...
4. Hence, possibly using the search function of the website

If there are copyright issues or any legal aspects I have not considered, let me know and I will try fix this.
I'm just a university student trying to remove the inconvenience of going through a lot of ads, please have mercy.
:)

Don't be cruel to the server.
